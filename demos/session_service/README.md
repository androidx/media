# Demo `MediaLibraryService` implementation

A library module with a demo implementation of `MediaLibraryService` and
`MediaLibrarySession.Callback`.

See the `PlaybackService` of the [session demo](../session/README.md) how to use
it. Override `assets/cataglog.json` by creating such a file in the same format
in your application module that the service will use.
