# UI module written using Jetpack Compose

Provides UI-related functionality such as Composable functions and Compose State
classes. For example, the Surface for rendering media playback, UI state classes
for widgets, buttons, and other interactive components.

## Getting the module

The easiest way to use the module is to add it as a gradle dependency:

```groovy
implementation 'androidx.media3:media3-ui-compose:1.X.X'
```

where `1.X.X` is the version, which must match the version of the other media
modules being used.

Alternatively, you can clone this GitHub project and depend on the module
locally. Instructions for doing this can be found in the [top level README][].
