/**
 * Remember the value of [ProgressStateWithTickCount] created based on the passed [Player] and
 * launch a coroutine to listen to [Player's][Player] changes. If the [Player] instance changes
 * between compositions, produce and remember a new value.
 *
 * [ProgressStateWithTickCount] is a state holder optimised for updates according to the discrete
 * number of ticks that make up the full progress. Non-textual UI components are limited in how much
 * progress they can show by their screen representation, such as the number of pixels. In this
 * case, it is more important to track progress in ticks/steps that correspond to a visible "jump"
 * rather than a particular real time or media time frequency. Make sure to tune the
 * [totalTickCount] value for the shape of the composable that is consuming this state. This will
 * help you keep the recomposition count low, since the updates will be triggered at the frequency
 * that matches the needs of the UI.
 *
 * @param player The player whose progress to observe.
 * @param totalTickCount If strictly greater than 0, specifies the amounts of discrete values,
 *   evenly distributed across the whole duration of the current media item. If 0,
 *   [ProgressStateWithTickCount.currentPositionProgress] and
 *   [ProgressStateWithTickCount.bufferedPositionProgress] will remain 0 until this value becomes
 *   positive. Must not be negative.
 * @param scope Coroutine scope whose context is used to launch the progress update job. When scoped
 *   to some UI element, the scope of the Composable will ensure the job is cancelled when the
 *   element is disposed.
 * @return The remembered [ProgressStateWithTickCount] instance.
