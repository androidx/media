    // following test tries to simulate this scenario by squeezing the 2 actions together (setter +
    // onClick) into a single Looper iteration. This is a practically unlikely scenario for a human
    // user's tapping to race with a programmatic change to the Player.

    // However, it is possible to achieve by changing the Player and straight away programmatically
    // invoking the tapping operation (via the ButtonState object) that internally sends an inverse
    // setting command to the Player in its new configuration (the onEvents message here is
    // irrelevant because we are operating on the live mutable Player object). The expectation then
    // is that the State object and Player finally synchronise, even if it means the UI interaction
    // would have been confusing.
