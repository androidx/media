# UI module written using Jetpack Compose with Material3 theming

Provides out of the box UI elements such as Composable icons and buttons.

## Getting the module

The easiest way to use the module is to add it as a gradle dependency:

```groovy
implementation 'androidx.media3:media3-ui-compose-material3:1.X.X'
```

where `1.X.X` is the version, which must match the version of the other media
modules being used.

Alternatively, you can clone this GitHub project and depend on the module
locally. Instructions for doing this can be found in the top level README.
