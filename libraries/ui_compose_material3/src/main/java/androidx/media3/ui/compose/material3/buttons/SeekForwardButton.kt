/**
 * A Material3 [IconButton][androidx.compose.material3.IconButton] that seeks forward in the current
 * media item.
 *
 * When clicked, it attempts to seek forward in the [player] by the amount returned by
 * [Player.getSeekForwardIncrement]. The button's state (e.g., whether it's enabled) is managed by a
 * [SeekForwardButtonState] instance derived from the provided [player].
 *
 * @param player The [Player] to control.
 * @param modifier The [Modifier] to be applied to the button.
 * @param painter The supplier for [Painter] used for the icon displayed on the button. Defaults to
 *   an icon that changes based on the seek forward increment.
 * @param contentDescription The content description for accessibility purposes. Defaults to a
 *   string that changes based on the seek forward increment.
 * @param onClick The action to be performed when the button is clicked. This lambda has
 *   [SeekForwardButtonState] as its receiver, providing access to the button's current state (e.g.,
 *   [SeekForwardButtonState.isEnabled]). The default behavior is to call
 *   [SeekForwardButtonState.onClick], which seeks forward in the current media item. Consumers can
 *   customize this behavior:
 * * To add custom logic while still performing the default seek forward action, call
 *   `this.onClick()` within your lambda.
 * * To completely override the default behavior, implement your custom logic without calling
 *   `this.onClick()`. Note that in this case, the button might still be enabled based on the player
 *   state, so ensure your custom logic handles cases where seeking is not possible.
