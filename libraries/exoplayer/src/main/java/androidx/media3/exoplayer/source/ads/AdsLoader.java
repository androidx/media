/**
 * Interface for loaders of ads, which can be used with {@link AdsMediaSource}.
 *
 * <p>Ads loaders notify the {@link AdsMediaSource} about events via {@link EventListener}. In
 * particular, implementations must call {@link EventListener#onAdPlaybackState(AdPlaybackState)}
 * with a new copy of the current {@link AdPlaybackState} whenever further information about ads
 * becomes known (for example, when an ad media URI is available, or an ad has played to the end).
 *
 * <p>{@link #start(AdsMediaSource, DataSpec, Object, AdViewProvider, EventListener)} will be called
 * when an ads media source first initializes, at which point the loader can request ads. If the
 * player enters the background, {@link #stop(AdsMediaSource, EventListener)} will be called.
 * Loaders should maintain any ad playback state in preparation for a later call to {@link
 * #start(AdsMediaSource, DataSpec, Object, AdViewProvider, EventListener)}. If an ad is playing
 * when the player is detached, update the ad playback state with the current playback position
 * using {@link AdPlaybackState#withAdResumePositionUs(long)}.
 *
 * <p>If {@link EventListener#onAdPlaybackState(AdPlaybackState)} has been called, the
 * implementation of {@link #start(AdsMediaSource, DataSpec, Object, AdViewProvider, EventListener)}
 * should invoke the same listener to provide the existing playback state to the new player.
