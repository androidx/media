/auth/token/issue

This endpoint generates a client-token for API authentication. The endpoint can only be accessed with an ApplicationKey.

A client-token authenticates a client with the device API endpoints that requires authentication. Use it by including the token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

It can be used in client applications, including web browsers and mobile apps. It's an alternativ to the ApplicationID that should be harder to abuse outside your application's browser environment.

A token is valid for a limited time, after which it expires. The default lifetime for a token is 1 hour. You can adjust this lifespan up to a maximum of 24 hours using the ttl parameter.

A token can be configured with the following optional restrictions:

Device connection key
Client IP
Client Origin
Client Referer
Client User-Agent
Client Accept-Language
Client Accept-Encoding
Client Cache-Control
Specifying a device connection key ensures that the token can only be used with a specific device.

The client values forms a lightweight client fingerprint that makes it harder to abuse the token outside the client environment.

NOTE: Issuing a client-token for a specific device does not eliminate the need to include the connection key when sending device commands.

The X-Connection-Key header is still required for device-specific operations, even if the client-token was issued for that device.

Token Renewal
Alongside the token, you receive a renew URL. Use this URL to extend your token's validity, ensuring uninterrupted service for long-running applications.

The renew URL remains valid as long as the token is valid. Remember to renew before the token expires; post-expiration, both the token and renew URL become invalid, necessitating a new token issue.

The renew operation only extends the token's lifespan. It does not alter initial restrictions (device connection key or other client values) set during token issuance.
